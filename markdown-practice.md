# My Learning Goals
This semester, my goal is to improve my programming skills and understand basic coding concepts like variables, loops, and functions. 
I want to write clear and efficient code, improve my problem-solving skills, and gain confidence in building small projects on my own.

## Text formatting
**In programming**, writing clean code requires *logical* thinking and understanding how to use functions like 'print()' correctly.
